<h3 align="center">Create a Crypto reporting system, using CoinMarketCap’s API 🖥️</h3><br />



<h2>📝Tasks</h2>
Every day, at a certain specific time, we wanna get as much information as possible about cryptocurrencies, process it and store the results in a JSON file.<br /><br /><br />

The following information will be written in the report:<br />

1) **The Crypto with the largest volume** *(in $)* of the last 24 hours.

2) **The best and worst 10 cryptocurrencies** *(by % increase)* of the last 24 hours.

3) **The amount of $** needed to buy one unit of **each of the top 20 cryptocurrencies**[^1]

4) **The amount of $** required to purchase **a unit of all Crypto whose volume in the last 24 hours exceeds 76,000,000$.**[^1]

5) **Profit/loss %** you would have made if you had bought one unit of each of the top 20 cryptocurrencies the day before (assuming that the rankings have not changed).<br /><br />


Once the project is complete, **send the report in JSON.**<br />
<sub>*To prevent your program from overwriting the same JSON file, name it with the ‘program run’ date (use datetime module).*</sub><br /><br /><br />
